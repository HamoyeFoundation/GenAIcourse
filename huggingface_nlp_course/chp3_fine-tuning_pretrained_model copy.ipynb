The second line involves instantiating an Accelerator object that analyzes the environment and initializes the appropriate distributed setup. 🤗 Accelerate takes care of device placement, so you can omit the lines responsible for placing the model on the device. Alternatively, you can modify them to use `accelerator.device` instead of `device`.\n",

    "The key step is encapsulated in the line where the dataloaders, model, and optimizer are sent to `accelerator.prepare()`. This call wraps these objects in the necessary container to ensure smooth operation of distributed training. The remaining adjustments include removing the line that places the batch on the device (or replacing it with `accelerator.device` if you prefer) and substituting `accelerator.backward(loss)` for `loss.backward()`."

    "Fantastic job! To summarize, in this chapter, you gained knowledge about datasets in the Hub, learned loading and preprocessing datasets, including dynamic padding and collators. Additionally, you implemented your own fine-tuning and evaluation of a model, created a lower-level training loop, and leveraged 🤗 Accelerate to seamlessly adapt your training loop for multiple GPUs or TPUs. You're now equipped with a solid understanding of fine-tuning models on your data. Great work!"
