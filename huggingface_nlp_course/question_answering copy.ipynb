    "**Delving into Extractive Question Answering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Question answering (QA) encompasses a variety of approaches, but in this section, we'll delve into the realm of extractive question answering. This involves formulating questions about a document and pinpointing the answers as text segments within the document itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, extractive QA resembles using a highlighter to mark relevant portions of the text and then extracting the essential information. This approach is particularly well-suited for scenarios where the answer is explicitly stated in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refine a BERT model using the SQuAD dataset, which comprises questions posed by human annotators on a collection of Wikipedia articles. This process will equip our model with the ability to generate predictions like the following:\n",

    "Encoder-only models like BERT excel at extracting answers to factual questions, such as \"Who invented the Transformer architecture?\" However, they struggle with open-ended questions like \"Why is the sky blue?\" To address these more challenging scenarios, encoder-decoder models like T5 and BART are employed. These models synthesize information in a manner akin to text summarization, generating comprehensive responses that go beyond simply extracting snippets from the provided text."

    "\n",
    "The SQuAD dataset serves as the primary academic benchmark for extractive question answering, and it's the dataset we'll utilize in this section. A more challenging variant, SQuAD v2, incorporates questions that lack answers. As long as your custom dataset adheres to the same structure, featuring columns for contexts, questions, and answers, you can readily adapt the steps outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Note on SQuAD Dataset\n",
    "The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a popular benchmark dataset in natural language processing (NLP). It's designed for evaluating machine comprehension by requiring models to read a passage of text and answer questions about it. SQuAD contains over 100,000 question-answer pairs created by crowd workers based on articles from various sources like Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question in SQuAD is associated with a specific passage or context paragraph, and the goal is for models to generate precise answers based solely on the information in that passage. This dataset has been pivotal in the development and evaluation of question-answering systems and has led to significant advancements in NLP research, especially in the field of machine reading comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers use SQuAD to train, test, and benchmark different models, aiming to achieve better accuracy and understanding in reading and answering questions. It's been instrumental in the development of various models like BERT, RoBERTa, and other transformer-based architectures in NLP."

Since we padded all samples to the maximum length, a data collator is not required, making the metric computation the primary focus. The complexity lies in post-processing the model's predictions into spans of text within the original examples. Once this is accomplished, the metric provided by the 🤗 Datasets library will handle most of the evaluation tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model will generate logits for the start and end positions of the answer within the input IDs. The post-processing stage will follow a similar approach to the one we employed there, so here's a brief recap of the steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Masking Irrelevant Tokens:** We'll mask the start and end logits corresponding to tokens that fall outside the context. This ensures that the model's attention is focused solely on the relevant portions of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic Conversion:** We'll convert the start and end logits into probabilities using a softmax function. This transformation effectively scales the logits into a range between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of each token being the start or end of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scoring Answer Spans:** We'll assign a score to each pair of `(start_token, end_token)` by multiplying the corresponding start and end probabilities. This scoring mechanism prioritizes answer spans with higher confidence levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identifying the Optimal Answer Span:** We'll identify the pair of `(start_token, end_token)` with the highest score, ensuring that the `start_token` precedes the `end_token`. This pair represents the most likely and valid answer span.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can effectively extract the most probable answer span from the model's predictions, enabling us to interpret and evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, we'll introduce slight modifications to the process since we only need to identify the predicted answer and not calculate actual scores. Consequently, we can bypass the softmax step, streamlining the process. To further enhance speed, we'll limit our analysis to the top `n_best` logits, eliminating the need to evaluate all possible `(start_token, end_token)` pairs. With `n_best=20`, we'll focus on the 20 most promising logits. Since we're not using softmax, the scores will be represented as logit scores, obtained by summing the start and end logits (rather than multiplying them, as the rule `log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)` states).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this approach, we'll utilize predictions generated by the default QA pipeline model on a small subset of the validation set. We can employ the same processing function as before; as it relies on the global constant `tokenizer`, we simply need to replace this object with the tokenizer of the model we intend to use temporarily.\n",
